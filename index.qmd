> *Tools for Open Research and Computation with HathiTrust: Leveraging Intelligent Text Extraction (TORCHLITE)*

It is a next-generation Web-based, interactive visualization and analytical tool dashboard that consumes existing data from our one-of-a-kind, fully open Extracted Features (EF) dataset, along with a well-documented API to allow our user community to develop its own tools for interacting with data from the 17.5-million-volume HathiTrust Digital Library.

Through this hackathon, we aim to develop and promote these tools and the API. The [EF dataset](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/datasets) contains nearly 3 trillion tokens representing over 6 billion pages, making it arguably the largest open dataset of its kind readily available to digital humanities and other scholars in the world.
