## Torchlight Next JS Backend API

This document describes the models and API specification for the Torchlite NextJS backend, which supports the needs of the NextJS front-end interface. The Torchlite application is composed of the following components:

-   the NextJS-based front-end interface (what the user sees in their browser)
-   the NextJS backend API (the server-side piece of the NextJS application)
-   the Torchlite API (implements the Torchlite business logic for dashboards, filters, and data management)
-   the Extracted Features API (used for accessing Extracted Features data for volumes and worksets)
-   the Registry API (used for retrieving public and user-private worksets managed through Analytics Gateway)

From the point of view of the Torchlite NextJS-based front-end interface, only the API exposed by the NextJS backend is relevant; there should be no direct communication between the front end and any of the other components outlined above.

The following sections will focus on the relationship between the front-end and NextJS backend, providing details about how they should function together.
