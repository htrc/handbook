## HTRC Extracted Features (EF) Dataset

-   Open access under a [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), and freely [downloadable](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/deriveddatasets)
-   Structured data consisting of human-created (catalog) metadata and algorithmically-derived features
-   Representing 17.1 million volumes, including those still under copyright (i.e., not quite in sync with the HathiTrust Digital Library )
-   Linked-data compliant (JSON-LD)
-   Complete documentation available at [https://go.illinois.edu/EF20_documentation](https://go.illinois.edu/EF20_documentation)

## What are "Extracted Features"?

Extracted features are computationally accessible data elements “extracted” (i.e., “derived”) from the HathiTrust Digital Library. They include:

-   Volume- and page-level metadata
-   Textual and statistical data and word-level metadata
-   Extracted from the raw full text of volumes in the Digital Library

EF positions researchers to access the data they need and begin their analysis of text with some standard natural language & statistical preprocessing already done for them.

## Per-volume features

Excerpted from catalog metadata, including:

-   Title
-   Author
-   Language
-   Publication information
-   Identifiers
-   \[in future releases: Subjects\]

Newly available as part of the TORCHLITE framework (but not yet included in older EF versions):
-   Token counts aggregated by volume.

## Extracted Features API

![](images/torchlite_diagram.jpg)

The Extracted Features API allows programmatic access to the Extracted Features Files and not only enables HTRC's TORCHLITE dashboard, but also allows users to connect their own code notebooks, widgets, or applications.

The [EF API  Documentation](https://htrc.stoplight.io/docs/ef-api/06db4dc572b49-ef) fully documents the available API calls and allows users to request sample calls in a number of different coding languages.
